## Description

For this project I created a password generator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Starter code was provided with expectation that the code would be modified to meet all outlined Acceptance Criteria. The endpoint is to successfully create a password generator that provides a secure random password based on user input when presented with a series of prompts/conditions for password criteria. Once generated this password should be displayed in an alert or written to the page. 

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

# Acceptance Criteria

- A new, secure password is required.
- When the button to generate a password is clicked then user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. The user then selects which criteria to include in the password for the following:
 1. Password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.  
 2. Confirmation of which character types to include in the password: lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters.

- User input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
- When all prompts are answered then a password is generated that matches all selected criteria.
- When password is generated it should display in an alert or written to the page.
